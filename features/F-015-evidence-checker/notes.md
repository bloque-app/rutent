# F-015 notes

Readings taken where `SPEC.md` or `PLAN.md` is silent or ambiguous, recorded per Narthex `REQ-SKL-24`.

## T-015-01

- The scale is not redefined. `EvidenceGrade`, `EvidencePiece` and `Evidence` (the per-provider declaration) already
  sit in the frozen provider-role contract; `components/evidence` imports them and adds the rules around them.
- "Claim above the declared grade" reads as a claim stronger than declared (a lower number): the declaration is what
  a floor can rely on, so a piece claiming more is refused for the whole outcome. A piece weaker than declared is not
  refused here; the outcome simply grades lower, and whether that clears the operator's floor is the router's call.
- "A statement alone is graded as a statement": a grade 1 or 2 claim counts only when a check backs it, a final
  matching public record (`verify_movement`) for 1, and that or a receipt from a different publisher for 2. An
  unbacked claim is graded 4, never as proof. Grades 3 and 4 need no check. Proof means grade 1 or 2. The outcome's
  grade is its best piece's.
- A receipt from the same publisher as the provider earns no check (`THR-124`): `receipt_check` returns `Unchecked`.
  It is downgraded to a statement rather than refusing the outcome, because the provider's own word still stands.
- The network interface carries finality and the reorg rule as declared data (`NetworkRules`), and the verdict on a
  movement as `Status` (unknown, pending, final, reorged out). The checker trusts the network to say when a movement
  is final; interpreting depth or checkpoints is each network's task in `F-031`. `T-015-02` builds the simulated
  network behind `PublicNetwork`.
- Movement-to-segment matching is by network, destination, asset and amount together, with the destination being the
  route's one destination. Amount alone never matches (`DEC-13`). Amounts are compared as the decimal strings the
  contracts use, in the segment's unit.
- One destination per route (`one_destination`): exactly one segment ends at an outer node, and it is the last, a
  deposit. Anything else is reported as a named violation, not panicked on and not guessed around.
- `proptest` is a dev-dependency (`DEC-18`); its lock additions have `licences/RECORD` lines, all permissive.

## T-015-02

- The simulated network is `SimulatedNetwork`, in its own module (`simnet`). It is a hand-driven chain: `record`
  puts a movement in the tip block, `advance` adds blocks, `checkpoint` covers every block to the tip, `reorg(depth)`
  undoes the newest `depth` blocks' movements. It imports nothing but the interface (`DEC-2`).
- Confirmations count the including block as the first, so `Confirmations(n)` is final when the tip is `n - 1`
  blocks past the including block. `Confirmations(0)` is read as `Confirmations(1)`. `Instant` is final on record.
  `Checkpoint` is final once a checkpoint taken at or after the including block's height exists.
- A reorg undoes a movement only when it is not final and the reorg rule allows it: `Never` protects every movement,
  `DepthBound(d)` protects one with more than `d` confirmations, `UntilFinal` protects only final ones. A final
  movement is never undone, whatever depth a reorg asks for. Reorgs do not lower the tip height.
- Recording a movement id the network already holds (not reorged out) is refused, as `T-015-01` reads a movement id
  as unreusable. A reorged-out id may be recorded again, in a new block, because a reorg puts the transaction back in
  the pool.
- A checkpoint covers the movements recorded before it, by order of recording, not by block: a movement recorded
  after a checkpoint, even into the same tip block, is not final until the next checkpoint. A reorged-out id may come
  back only with the movement it first named, since a transaction id fixes its content (`ContentChanged` otherwise).
