# F-008 notes

Readings taken where `SPEC.md` or `PLAN.md` is silent or ambiguous, recorded per Narthex `REQ-SKL-24`. The
experiment's own questions and defaults are in `experiments/2026-11-07-module-format/decisions.json`; the record's
readings are in its README, "Readings taken in opening it".

## T-008-01

- **Drafted before its dependency landed, then reconciled.** `T-008-01` depends on `T-003-03`, the module-boundary
  suite. The record was first drafted with the suite's cell names assumed from `AC-19` to `AC-21` and the plan;
  once the suite was on `m1` (`a443665`), the sheet's suite rows were rewritten from its 15 checks and 41 fixtures
  and controls (`M-01` to `M-16`), and the record rebased onto it.
- **Stand-ins per format.** `DEC-7` asks for one stand-in per provider category in two languages, and `T-008-03`
  for "the same stand-ins". Read as per format: four categories, two languages, two formats.
- **The restart test.** `restarting one provider's process leaves the others running` (`REQ-MDL-13`) is in
  `T-008-02`'s row, not `T-003-03`'s, but the suite carries it under `ProvidersAreIsolated` (`M-15`). Whether the
  process it restarts is a real OS process is scored by `B-07`.
- **A plan point, not raised as an item.** `PLAN.md` §6.2, risk 3, reads PVM as having one guest language, after
  ADR-0003. At PolkaVM `v0.38.0` the tree also carries a C guest header, with no C guest program or test. This is
  what `T-008-03` is for; the sheet scores it as `G-22`, and the ADR-0003 amendment draft lists it to reconcile.
